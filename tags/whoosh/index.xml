      <description>Full text searching with fast indexing is essential to go through large quantities of text in Pandas dataframes to power your data science workflows. Traditionally, we can use a full text search engine databases like Elasticsearch, Apache Solr or Amazon cloudsearch for this; however, it&amp;rsquo;s pretty impractical to do that for one off requirements or when working with only few GBs of data.
In that case, you can simply load your text into Pandas dataframe, and use regex to perform the search as shown.</description>

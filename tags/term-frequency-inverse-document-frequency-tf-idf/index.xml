      <description>In the previous post, we looked at count vectorization to convert a given document into a sparse vectors which can be used as features for text classification task such as classifying emails into spam or not spam.
Count vectorization has one major drawback: it gives equal weightage to all the words (or tokens) present in the corpus, and this makes it a poor representation for the semantic analysis of the sentence.</description>

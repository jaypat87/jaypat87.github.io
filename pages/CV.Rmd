**PROFILE:**  

- Data scientist with over five years’ experience in data analytics, machine learning, statistics and text mining.  
  
- I have coauthored 1 book, 10 papers, 26 conference presentations and am passionate about explaining data science to non-technical business audiences. 
  
- Frequent speaker at data science events hosted by Federal community of practice (CoP) as part of DigitalGov initiative.

**PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE:**  

- US ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY, ATHENS, GA, USA \hfill (12/2015 – Present)      
Office of Research and Development (ORD)  
**Data Scientist (ORISE Fellow)**  

    + Fulfill all the data science duties for US EPA’s and US FDA’s joint Tox21 program and chemistry safety for sustainability (CSS) program.
  
    + Compile and curate data from various sources and use that to develop machine learning based classification and regression models.
  
    + Work with external stakeholders in development on best standard practices on regression and statistical modeling by being an official voting member on ASTM Committee E11 on Quality and Statistics
  
- PMGB LTD. CO., ATHENS, GA, USA \hfill (05/2013 – 11/2015)    
**Data Scientist**  

    + Directed development of a predictive machine learning based model [(more info)](http://www.jaympatel.com/assets/DoD_SERDP_case_study.pdf) as part of a contract valued at over $100,000 with US federal government (Order no. EP13W000134 and EP14W000201, DBA “Patel, Jay”).
  
    + Led two data analysts for development of decision analytics dashboard to generate regulatory intelligence insights to guide quality management systems required for continued cGMP compliance as per ICH/US FDA guidelines by text mining data from US FDA warning letters and a custom Form 483 database.
  
- THE UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA \hfill (08/2010 – 05/2013)      
Franklin College of Arts and Sciences  
**Research Associate**  

    + Designed and applied a virtual screening workflow based on machine learning classification model to identify high activity enzyme mutations (virtual screening) and validated it experimentally using site saturation mutagenesis.
  
    + In a separate project, developed a partial least square model for predicting solvation energies for a enzyme mutation and experimentally validated it.
  
    + Project resulted in four peer reviewed papers in top international journals (Impact factor ~10).
  
**TECHNICAL SKILLS:**  

- **Machine Learning:** classification and regression (support vector machine, partial least square, random forest etc), clustering, feature engineering.
  
- **Statistical Methods:** regression models, hypothesis testing and confidence intervals, time series, principal component analysis and dimensionality reduction.
  
- **Software and Programming Languages:** Python (scikit-learn,matplotlib, numpy, scipy, pandas), R (shiny, knitr, ggplot2 and other tidyverse packages, caret, e1071, randomforest), SQL, Weka, Eclipse RCP/Java, KNIME, Microsoft Excel, LaTeX.
  
**EDUCATION:**

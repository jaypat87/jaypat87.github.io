      <description>Hi! My name is Jay M. Patel and Iâ€™ve been working fulltime as freelance software developer and data scientist on data mining, web crawling/scraping, natural language processing (NLP) projects.
I am also bootstraping my startup project Specrom Analytics which uses AI algorithms for marketing, social listening and creating alternative financial datasets.
I wrote an algorithmic (or quantitative) trading program for my first client back in 2007 while still in college, and I have been investing in stocks ever since with particular focus on healthcare and biotech stocks.</description>

      <description>Let us consider a simple task of classifying a given email into spam or not spam. As you might have already guessed, this is an example of a simple binary classification problem with target or label values being 0 or 1, within the larger field of supervised machine learning (ML).
However, we still need to convert non-numerical text contained in emails into numerical features which can be fed into a ML algorithm of our choice.</description>

      <description>In the previous post, we looked at count vectorization to convert a given document into a sparse vectors which can be used as features for text classification task such as classifying emails into spam or not spam.
Count vectorization has one major drawback: it gives equal weightage to all the words (or tokens) present in the corpus, and this makes it a poor representation for the semantic analysis of the sentence.</description>

      <description>Machine Learning Basics 1. What is machine learning? Machine learning (ML) is a field of computer science that gives computer systems the ability to progressively improve performance on a specific task aka learn with data without being explicitly programmed. Taking a 50,000 ft view, we want to model a given dataset either to make predictions or we want a model to describe a given dataset to gain valuable insights.</description>

      <description>Git is probably the most popular version control system being used right now, and if you have any experience with other version control systems like subversion than it&amp;rsquo;s strongly recommended that you go through this section since lot of concepts from other systems don&amp;rsquo;t directly translate to Git.
Git Basics You can create a local Git repository on your computer by either:
 Clone an existing Git repository from a remote repository on internet (e.</description>
